                            <p id="ld1">People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasnâ€™t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.</p>

                    <p id="ld2">Life is the most precious thing we have. A gift we are given, but a gift some squander. We need to be alive, not just exist. This is where The Pig steps in - a teacher that provides those selected with an opportunity to appreciate life yet again. To fight for our own survival, or simply let go and die. David Tapp thinks otherwise. He believes that everyone is free to live their own life, without the threat of death in the shape of a trap. A seasoned detective that seeks The Pig - a search that brings him to the Gideon Meat Plant.</p>
